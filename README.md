# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Power Generation: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of wind turbine power generation data. 
Part 1 aims to uncover the key patterns, trends, and relationships between wind speed, direction, and generated power. 
Includes visual analytics, domain insights, and groundwork for predictive modelling.
Part 2 aims to train a model (Random Forest / XGBoost) to predict power from available features. 



## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the **seasonal and temporal variability** in wind power generation.
- Understand how **wind speed and direction** affect turbine output.
- Identify performance-critical **cut-in and rated wind speed thresholds**.
- Provide insights useful for **forecasting, optimization, and maintenance scheduling**.
- Set the foundation for **predictive modeling** and potential deployment.

## 📊 Key Insights

* **Wind Speed vs Power**: Strong non-linear relationship observed; power increases sharply from 3–10 m/s and flattens after \~12 m/s.
* **Temporal Patterns**:

  * Power output is highest between **1:00–6:00**.
  * **Winter months** (Dec–Jan) show higher and more stable generation.
* **Wind Direction**:

  * Prevailing winds come from the **North-East quadrant**.
  * Directional changes influence power generation patterns.
* **Turbine Behavior**:

  * Power output drops to zero below ~ 3 m/s (cut-in) and saturates after ~12 m/s.
  * Possible misalignment or noise observed in outliers — useful for quality assurance.

## 📅 Features Engineered

* `wind_speed_diff`: difference between 100m and 10m wind speeds
* `hour`, `month`, `dayofweek`: for diurnal and seasonal analysis

---

## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3.11**
* `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* `scikit-learn` (planned for modeling)
* `statsmodels` (for time decomposition)
* `scipy` (for correlation and statistical testing)
* `mpl_toolkits` (3D visualization)

## 🧠 What's Next?

* 🔮 **Part-2: Modeling Stage** (in progress):

  * Train a regression model (Random Forest / XGBoost) to predict power from wind conditions and other available features in the dataset.
  * Evaluate model performance (MAE, R²).
  * Analyze feature importances using SHAP values.

* 🌐 **Deployment Stage**:

  * Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
  * Let users explore power curves and seasonal trends dynamically.
